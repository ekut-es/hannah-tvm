This directory contains an M3 based "demo" runtime environment that
pulls together the microTVM runtime dependencies into a single application
that can communicate with a Python-based host program via the UART, using
TVM's RPC protocol.

It is heavily based on the microtvm zephyr template from original tvm repo.
